## Overview 
The PiRogue Tool Suite (PTS) is an open-source consensual digital forensics and incident response solution designed to empower organizations with the tools necessary to conduct investigations and manage security incidents. The suite includes both hardware and software components, providing a robust platform for analyzing mobile devices, network traffic, and digital artifacts.

At the core of the PiRogue Tool Suite lies the **PiRogue** hardware device, a Raspberry Pi based network router that captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time. This hardware component serves as the foundation for the suite's extensive software capabilities, which include:

* **Network traffic analysis**: The PiRogue enables deep packet inspection of network traffic, facilitating the identification of suspicious patterns and potential threats.

* **Mobile forensic**: The PiRogue allows for the consensual extraction and analysis of data from mobile devices, including messages and application data, providing valuable insights into the user activity.

* **Mobile app and malware analysis**: The PiRogue is capable of dynamically instrumenting mobile applications and operating system to trace all network communication, data collection and cryptographic operations, providing evidence of data transmission and malicious activities.

The PiRogue Tool Suite's capabilities are enhanced by the **Colander** web platform, a case and incident response management platform that integrates seamlessly with the hardware and software components. Colander provides a centralized hub for managing investigations, streamlining workflows, and enabling effective collaboration among team members.

* **Knowledge management**: Colander facilitates the organization and sharing of investigative knowledge, ensuring that insights are readily available to team members, promoting collaboration and efficiency.

* **Artifact management**: Colander streamlines the handling and preservation of digital evidence, maintaining chain of custody and facilitating admissibility in legal proceedings.

The PiRogue Tool Suite offers several key advantages that make it an attractive option for organizations seeking a comprehensive and cost-effective solution for digital investigations:

* **Open-source**: The open-source nature of the project makes it accessible to organizations with limited budgets, removing financial barriers to acquiring powerful investigative tools.

* **Comprehensive toolset**: The suite provides a wide range of tools for both mobile forensics and network traffic analysis, catering to diverse investigative needs and ensuring thoroughness in evidence collection.

* **User-friendly design**: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, even for non-technical users, minimizing the learning curve and enabling an efficient adoption.

* **Flexibility**: The modular design allows for easy integration with existing systems and workflows, facilitating compatibility with existing infrastructure and processes.

* **Community support**: The active open-source community provides ongoing support and development, ensuring that the suite remains up-to-date and continuously improves and adapts to evolving needs.
